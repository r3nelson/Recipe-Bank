If I make changes to my models.py file later the table in my postgres db will not update automatically.

I can add these changes to my database using alembic

alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Added new column"
alembic upgrade head

stick to async for I/O bound operations
sync is fine for CPU based calculations
if you have to use sync with async look into allocating another thread.
